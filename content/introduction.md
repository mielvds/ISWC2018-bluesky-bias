## Introduction
{:#introduction}

- Researchers have a bias towards other reviewers
- we present
    - the Enemy-of-an-Enemy (EoaE) ontology
    - a relative and absolute bias score for researchers in context of a particular paper
    - sub-metrics needed and how to calculated them
    - we populate an Enemy knowledge base based on the bias scores of researchers
    - possible uses: complement to the confidence, auto calculation of Conflict of Intrests
